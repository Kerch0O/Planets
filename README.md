# Planets
 Implementation of 2D 2-Body Simulation with Pygame
 
 Purpose was to develop my python skills,
 Created Planet and Vector2f data types, including constructors and operator overloading for vector type
 
 Used Pygame for the first time, learning how to use basic clear,draw,display and while using surfaces time and more
 
 Simulated gravitational forces between planets using Newton's F = G(m1m2) / r^2 and used Semi-Implicit integration to handle velocities and positions.
